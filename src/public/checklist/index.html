    <ul class="list-group mx-md-5">
  <li class="list-group-item">- Test drive the vehicle in town and highway speeds of 60 mpg or higher. Did you feel any vibrations driving or braking? Was the steering wheel straight while driving? Did it pull to one side? Any unusual sounds or smells? </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Test all interior controls. Check heater and A/C </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Any warning lights illuminated on dash?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Check trunk area for spare, tools and jack.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Take your time and slowly walk around the car. Are there excessive chips, scratches, dings, dents, scuffed wheels, etc. Do all body panels properly align? Stand back - does paint colors match from panel to panel? </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- How do the tires look? Do they all match? Are they a reputable brand? Michelin, Continental, etc. Tires are expensive– Measure? (10mm is new / 5mm is half) </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Carefully look at the interior in the front and rear area.. Note the condition of the seating surfaces, headliner and carpet for stains, tears, scratches. How does it smell?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Get the Carfax history. Make them show you on the computer screen and verify V.I.N. number.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- How did they acquire the car? Is previous customer available to speak with? Was it an auction car?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Did dealer inspect for prior accident damage? Ask how that inspection process works? Carfax is not a guarantee of an accident free car and the dealer knows it!</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Did they inspect the car? Ask for a copy of inspection with repairs and services performed. Did they change oil? Brake pads measure? 4mm minimum. Tires measure? 5mm minimum. If they care they measured! </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Do they have owners manual? ($50.00) Do they have extra key w/ remote? ($200-$400) Floormats? ($150)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Is vehicle still under warranty? Have any guarantees?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Make notes of all money you will spend getting vehicle to your standard or items that will need attention soon.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">- Will the dealer let you do an independent inspection if you deem necessary?</li>
